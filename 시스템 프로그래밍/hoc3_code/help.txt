           There are many functions beyond a calculator in HOC
             HOC can get the answer about a simple operation
           
          Also HOC can display the graph of functions on 2 ways 
              If you want draw a graph, Please type 'graph'
           And then you can see the description to draw a graph

              You must be confused with lots of operations
         I'm sure that because HOC can make you get into the swing
                        Just then, type 'clear' 
                       Your screen will be clear!

                     Thank you for using my program
                        
                                JUST FUN
